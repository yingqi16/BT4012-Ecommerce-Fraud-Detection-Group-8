## Introduction
E-commerce fraud includes various kinds of malicious actions designed to exploit digital businesses. Common types of E-commerce fraud include Card Testing Fraud and Account Takeover Fraud. As the COVID-19 pandemic limited physical sales and purchases, this led to a rise in e-commerce. In 2020, global E-commerce sales achieved 209% year-over-year revenue growth (Columbus, 2020). The fast-growing industry created opportunities for fraudsters to target digital businesses. A study projected that the total cost of E-commerce fraud to merchants will surpass $48 billion globally in 2023, a $7 billion jump from 2022 (Schwartz, 2022). In response to the fraud transactions, businesses are opting for a multi-pronged approach such as checking customersâ€™ order histories, verifying billing addresses and monitoring transaction data (Dopson, n.d.).

Therefore, we aim to create a classification model that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on the transaction and customer details to help online retailers protect themselves against fraudsters which could lead to tarnished reputation and huge monetary losses.

## Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is **transaction and customer details are indicative of the transaction status (fraud or normal)**.
